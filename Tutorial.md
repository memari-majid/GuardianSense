## 1. Introduction to AI Agents

An **AI Agent** is a system that perceives its environment through sensors, processes the data, and takes actions autonomously to achieve specific goals. In this project, the AI agent aims to detect medical emergencies by analyzing multiple types of data:

- **Text**: Patient statements or medical notes.
- **Images**: Facial expressions indicating pain or distress.
- **Audio**: Speech content that may suggest an emergency.
- **Video**: Movements indicating falls or accidents.
- **Physiological Data**: Vital signs like heart rate and blood pressure.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Autonomous Agent**: Operates independently without continuous human guidance.
- **Multimodal Agent**: Processes and integrates multiple types of data.
- **Intelligent Agent**: Makes decisions based on AI algorithms and models.

## 2. Overview of the Code

The code is structured to perform the following tasks:

1. **Initialize AI Models**: Sets up models for text, speech, image, and video analysis.
2. **Data Acquisition**: Simulates or accepts input data from various modalities.
3. **Data Processing**: Processes each data type using appropriate AI models.
4. **Data Fusion**: Combines insights from all modalities to make an informed decision.
5. **Decision-Making**: Determines if a medical emergency is occurring.
6. **User Interface**: Provides a Streamlit-based GUI for user interaction.
7. **Alert Mechanism**: Triggers visual and auditory alerts if an emergency is detected.
8. **Interactive Q&A**: Allows users to ask questions, with answers generated by the LLaMA model.
