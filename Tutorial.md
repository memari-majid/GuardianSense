# Multimodal Medical Emergency Detection Agent with Q&A via Ollama LLaMA 3.2 RAG System

## Overview of the Code

The presented code creates a **Multimodal Medical Emergency Detection Agent** designed to autonomously detect emergencies by analyzing multiple data modalities such as video, audio, text, and physiological data. It integrates pretrained models via the Ollama API, using **LLaMA 3.2** as the core reasoning engine in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. The agent is intended for real-time application and aims to assist disabled individuals by detecting medical emergencies and alerting caregivers or authorities.

This project is built on a combination of various AI models for speech, text, and image analysis, wrapped in a user-friendly interface provided by **Streamlit**. Additionally, it incorporates synthetic data generation for testing purposes and integrates multiple AI functionalities to form a cohesive decision-making agent.

## Detailed Code Explanation

### 1. **Library Importing**
The code begins by importing essential libraries:

- **Core Libraries**: These include `random`, `time`, `os`, `json`, and `warnings`. They are used for handling randomness, timing operations, file system interactions, and warnings.
- **CV2 (OpenCV)**: Used for video processing, specifically for detecting falls in the environment.
- **Torch (PyTorch)**: Utilized for neural network operations, specifically for speech-to-text conversion with a Wav2Vec2 model.
- **Librosa**: Handles audio file loading and analysis.
- **Transformers (HuggingFace)**: Includes the `Wav2Vec2ForCTC` and `Wav2Vec2Processor` models for speech recognition.
- **PIL (Python Imaging Library)**: Used to load and process images for emotion detection.
- **Streamlit**: Provides the graphical user interface (GUI) for the web application.

### 2. **Custom CSS for UI**
The function `add_custom_css()` introduces custom CSS to style the Streamlit web application. The design includes enhanced UI elements like buttons and emergency alerts to improve user interaction and visibility during an emergency detection scenario.

### 3. **Audio Encoding**
The `get_audio_base64()` function is a helper that converts an audio file into base64 encoding. This is useful for embedding audio within HTML, such as playing an alarm sound during a medical emergency.

### 4. **LLaMA Initialization via Ollama**
In the `initialize_llama_via_ollama()` function, the agent communicates with the **Ollama** server to initialize and utilize the **LLaMA 3.2 RAG** model for natural language processing. The model is designed to handle medical question-answering and emergency analysis by streaming responses.

### 5. **Synthetic Data Generation**
The `generate_synthetic_data()` function creates synthetic physiological data that mimics the output of health monitoring devices such as Apple Watches. This data is used to simulate real-time health parameters like heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and more. The generated data will later be fused with other input modalities to assess potential emergencies.

### 6. **Video Processing**
In the `process_video()` function, the agent processes a video file to detect specific actions like falls. The detection mechanism is currently simulated by randomly determining whether a fall has occurred. In a real-world scenario, this would be replaced by an AI-based action recognition model.

### 7. **Image Processing**
The `process_image()` function analyzes facial expressions from an image. The dominant emotion (e.g., happy, sad, angry, neutral) is simulated for this example but can be replaced with actual emotion recognition models in future implementations.

### 8. **Speech Processing**
The `process_speech()` function converts speech from an audio file into text using the **Wav2Vec2** model, a powerful neural network pretrained for speech recognition tasks. The speech-to-text output is then available for further analysis, such as detecting verbal cues of distress or medical emergencies.

### 9. **Text Processing with LLaMA**
The `process_text_llama()` function leverages the **LLaMA 3.2** model to analyze input text. It creates a prompt asking the model to assess whether there is an emergency based on the given text. This is particularly useful for analyzing user-provided statements or medical records in textual form.

### 10. **Data Fusion and Decision-Making**
The core of the agent lies in the `data_fusion()` function. Here, the physiological data, video analysis (fall detection), image emotion analysis, speech text, and text analysis are combined. Based on preset rules (e.g., if more than two alerts are triggered), the system determines whether there is an emergency and decides if an alarm should be triggered.

### 11. **Streamlit GUI Application**
The `medical_emergency_agent()` function forms the main entry point for the Streamlit-based web application. The app allows users to upload various file types (videos, images, audio, text) and process them in real-time. The user can switch between modes such as uploading files or viewing the analysis results. In the results mode, the agent presents its decision on whether an emergency is detected, and if so, triggers visual and audio alarms.

### 12. **Emergency Alarm and Fact-Checking**
If an emergency is detected, the system not only triggers an alarm but also allows users to ask additional questions about the analyzed data. The **LLaMA 3.2** model is utilized here for question-answering, and a built-in fact-checking mechanism reviews the generated responses to ensure accuracy.

### 13. **Running the Application**
The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ensures that the Streamlit application starts when the script is executed. It calls the `medical_emergency_agent()` function, which runs the GUI and processes the multimodal inputs for emergency detection.

## Applications in "AI in Action" Course

This code serves as an excellent practical example for teaching AI agents and multimodal autonomous systems. Key learning points include:

- **Multimodal Integration**: Demonstrates how data from different sources (video, audio, text, physiological data) can be processed and fused to make intelligent decisions.
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Introduces students to real-world applications of LLMs such as **LLaMA** for understanding complex inputs and answering medical questions.
- **Autonomous Agents**: Explains how AI-driven agents can function autonomously to detect critical situations, demonstrating the importance of AI in safety and healthcare applications.
- **AI for Accessibility**: Shows how AI can be used to assist disabled individuals by continuously monitoring their environment and responding to emergencies in real-time.

This example can be used in assignments where students extend the functionality, such as integrating more advanced models for video analysis or improving the decision-making algorithms with additional medical knowledge.
