## 1. Introduction to AI Agents

An **AI Agent** is a system that perceives its environment through sensors, processes the data, and takes actions autonomously to achieve specific goals. In this project, the AI agent aims to detect medical emergencies by analyzing multiple types of data:

- **Text**: Patient statements or medical notes.
- **Images**: Facial expressions indicating pain or distress.
- **Audio**: Speech content that may suggest an emergency.
- **Video**: Movements indicating falls or accidents.
- **Physiological Data**: Vital signs like heart rate and blood pressure.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Autonomous Agent**: Operates independently without continuous human guidance.
- **Multimodal Agent**: Processes and integrates multiple types of data.
- **Intelligent Agent**: Makes decisions based on AI algorithms and models.

## 2. Overview of the Code

The code is structured to perform the following tasks:

1. **Initialize AI Models**: Sets up models for text, speech, image, and video analysis.
2. **Data Acquisition**: Simulates or accepts input data from various modalities.
3. **Data Processing**: Processes each data type using appropriate AI models.
4. **Data Fusion**: Combines insights from all modalities to make an informed decision.
5. **Decision-Making**: Determines if a medical emergency is occurring.
6. **User Interface**: Provides a Streamlit-based GUI for user interaction.
7. **Alert Mechanism**: Triggers visual and auditory alerts if an emergency is detected.
8. **Interactive Q&A**: Allows users to ask questions, with answers generated by the LLaMA model.

## 3. Detailed Code Explanation

### 3.1 Importing Libraries

**Purpose:** Import necessary libraries for data processing, AI models, and GUI creation.

```python
import random
import time
import cv2
import numpy as np
import torch
import librosa
import warnings
import requests
import json
import os
import base64
from transformers import Wav2Vec2ForCTC, Wav2Vec2Processor
from PIL import Image
import streamlit as st
```

**Explanation:**

- `random`, `time`, `os`, `json`, `base64`, `warnings`: Standard Python libraries for general-purpose functions.
- `cv2` (OpenCV): Used for video processing tasks.
- `numpy`: Numerical operations, though not explicitly used in the code snippet.
- `torch` (PyTorch): Runs deep learning models, especially for speech recognition.
- `librosa`: Audio processing library for loading and transforming audio data.
- `requests`: Handles HTTP requests to interact with the Ollama API.
- `transformers`: Provides pre-trained models like Wav2Vec2 for speech-to-text.
- `PIL` (Python Imaging Library): Image processing for analyzing facial expressions.
- `streamlit`: Creates the web-based GUI.

Note: The `warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")` statement suppresses warnings to keep the output clean.

### 3.2 Custom CSS for UI Enhancement

**Purpose:** Enhance the visual appeal of the Streamlit app using custom CSS.

```python
def add_custom_css():
    st.markdown(
        """
        <style>
        /* CSS styles here */
        </style>
        """,
        unsafe_allow_html=True
    )
```

**Explanation:**

- `st.markdown()`: Allows rendering of Markdown and HTML in Streamlit.
- `unsafe_allow_html=True`: Permits the inclusion of raw HTML/CSS.
- CSS Styles Include:
    - Body and Main: Sets font family and background color.
    - Button Styles: Customizes the appearance of buttons.
    - Emergency Alert: Defines styles for the emergency alert banner, including animations.

### 3.3 Audio Encoding Function

**Purpose:** Encode an audio file to Base64 to embed it in HTML for playback.

```python
def get_audio_base64(file_path):
    # Function body
```

**Explanation:**

- Base64 Encoding: Converts binary audio data into a text format that can be embedded in HTML.
- Usage: Allows the app to play an alarm sound directly in the browser.

### 3.4 Initializing LLaMA via Ollama

**Purpose:** Set up the connection to the LLaMA model via the Ollama API.

```python
def initialize_llama_via_ollama():
    # Function body
```

**Explanation:**

- Base URL: `http://localhost:11434/` is the default port for the Ollama API.
- `llama_model(prompt)`: Sends a prompt to the LLaMA model and retrieves the response.
- Streaming Response: Processes the response in real-time, suitable for large outputs.

**Usage in Code:**

This function is called once to initialize the model and is used whenever text analysis is required.

### 3.5 Synthetic Data Generation

**Purpose:** Simulate physiological data similar to what might be collected by wearable devices.

```python
def generate_synthetic_data():
    # Function body
```

**Explanation:**

Data Generated:

- Heart Rate: Random value between 50 and 150 bpm.
- Oxygen Saturation: Random float between 85% and 100%.
- Blood Pressure: Random systolic and diastolic values.
- Steps, Calories, Sleep Hours: Random values for additional context.

**Usage in Code:**

Provides test data for the agent to analyze without needing actual health devices.

### 3.6 Video Processing Function

**Purpose:** Analyze video input to detect falls.

```python
def process_video(video_path):
    # Function body
```

**Explanation:**

- Simulation: Randomly determines if a fall is detected (True or False).
- Error Handling: Checks if the video file exists and handles exceptions.

Note: In a real-world scenario, this function would implement actual fall detection algorithms using computer vision techniques.

### 3.7 Image Processing Function

**Purpose:** Detect the dominant emotion from an image.

```python
def process_image(image_path):
    # Function body
```

**Explanation:**

- Emotion List: ['happy', 'sad', 'angry', 'surprised', 'neutral'].
- Dominant Emotion: Randomly selected from the emotion list.
- Error Handling: Checks if the image file exists and handles exceptions.

Note: In practice, this would involve using a pre-trained facial emotion recognition model.

### 3.8 Speech Processing Function

**Purpose:** Convert speech from an audio file into text.

```python
def process_speech(audio_path):
    # Function body
```

**Explanation:**

Models Used:

- Wav2Vec2Processor: Tokenizes audio data.
- Wav2Vec2ForCTC: Pre-trained model for speech-to-text.

Process:

- Load audio at 16kHz.
- Tokenize and generate input values.
- Perform inference to get logits.
- Decode predicted IDs to get the transcription.

Error Handling: Manages cases where audio is empty or cannot be read.

### 3.9 Text Processing with LLaMA

**Purpose:** Analyze input text to determine if it indicates a medical emergency.

```python
def process_text_llama(input_text, llama_model):
    # Function body
```

**Explanation:**

- Prompt Creation: Constructs a prompt that asks the LLaMA model to analyze the text.
- Response Handling: Returns the model's analysis or an error message.

### 3.10 Data Fusion and Decision-Making

**Purpose:** Combine data from all modalities to decide if an emergency is occurring.

```python
def data_fusion(physio_data, fall_detected, emotion, speech_text, speech_analysis, text_analysis):
    # Function body
```

**Explanation:**

- Alerts List: Collects all alerts based on abnormal findings.
- Decision Logic:
    - If two or more alerts are present, it's considered an emergency.
    - Provides warnings if data from any modality is missing or invalid.
- Outputs:
    - alerts: List of alert messages.
    - decision: Final decision message.
    - warnings_list: Any warnings generated during processing.
    - emergency_detected: Boolean indicating if an emergency is detected.

### 3.11 Streamlit GUI Application
