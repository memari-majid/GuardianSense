# Multimodal Medical Emergency Detection Agent with Q&A via Ollama LLaMA 3.2 RAG System

## Overview of the Code

The presented code creates a **Multimodal Medical Emergency Detection Agent**, a real-world example of an **AI Agent**. An **AI Agent** is an entity that perceives its environment through various input modalities, processes the data, and takes autonomous actions to achieve a specific goal. In this case, the goal is to detect emergencies and alert caregivers when necessary. This AI agent is multimodal because it processes several types of data simultaneously: video, audio, text, and physiological data.

### What is an AI Agent?

An **AI Agent** is defined as a system that is capable of making decisions or taking actions autonomously based on inputs from its environment. AI agents often include capabilities such as perception, reasoning, and action, similar to human agents. In this context, terms like:

- **Autonomous Agent**: Refers to the system's ability to operate independently without constant human input. For example, the emergency detection agent in this code autonomously monitors the environment and alerts authorities based on the results of its analysis.
  
- **Agentic System**: Refers to systems where multiple agents interact and collaborate, often seen in multi-agent environments. While this system operates as a single agent, it could be part of a larger **agentic system** in a healthcare setting.

- **Intelligent Agent**: This agent is intelligent because it applies AI algorithms such as deep learning models to make informed decisions about emergency detection. 

This project leverages AI models for speech, text, and image analysis, integrates them into a user-friendly interface, and includes synthetic data generation for testing. Students can modify or extend this code to add new functionality, such as using real-time health data streams.

## Detailed Code Explanation

### 1. **Library Importing**
The code begins by importing the necessary libraries. Each of these libraries performs specific tasks for the multimodal agent:

- **Core Libraries**: 
  - `random`: Used to introduce randomness in synthetic data generation.
  - `time`: Helps measure or delay time in real-time processing tasks.
  - `os`: Manages file system operations (checking file existence, paths, etc.).
  - `json`: Used to process JSON data, especially for input and output handling.
  - `warnings`: Used to suppress irrelevant warnings for cleaner output during testing.

- **CV2 (OpenCV)**: Handles video processing tasks such as detecting falls. In this context, OpenCV can be thought of as a **perception module** for the agent, enabling it to "see" the environment.

- **Torch (PyTorch)**: Used to run deep learning models for tasks like speech recognition. PyTorch handles the processing of neural networks for tasks like speech-to-text conversion with the Wav2Vec2 model.

- **Librosa**: Processes and loads audio files, transforming them into formats suitable for AI models to analyze. Audio data is a crucial part of **multimodal analysis** in AI agents.

- **Transformers (HuggingFace)**: Implements pretrained transformer models, specifically **Wav2Vec2**, which is used here to perform automatic speech recognition (ASR).

- **PIL (Python Imaging Library)**: Loads and processes image files, allowing the agent to perform emotion detection based on facial expressions. This is another aspect of the agent's perception capabilities.

- **Streamlit**: Provides the user interface (UI) framework for the agent, enabling interaction between the user and the AI system through a web application. This UI serves as the **interaction layer** between the human user and the autonomous agent.

### 2. **Custom CSS for UI**
The function `add_custom_css()` defines custom styles to enhance the appearance of the Streamlit app. It gives a polished, user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to interact with the AI agent. The visual design elements like animations and buttons ensure that the emergency alerts are clear and noticeable.

### 3. **Audio Encoding**
The `get_audio_base64()` function helps encode audio files in base64 format, a standard encoding that allows binary data (like audio) to be included in web-based applications. This functionality enables the system to play an alarm sound when an emergency is detected, providing both a visual and auditory cue to the user.

### 4. **LLaMA Initialization via Ollama**
The `initialize_llama_via_ollama()` function initializes the **LLaMA 3.2** model using Ollama's API. In the context of AI agents, LLaMA acts as a **reasoning engine** that processes and answers natural language questions related to the data. This is crucial for an agent's ability to **communicate** effectively with humans and **reason** based on complex textual inputs.

### 5. **Synthetic Data Generation**
The `generate_synthetic_data()` function simulates health metrics like heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation, mimicking real-world sensor data from devices like Apple Watches. In teaching, you can explain how AI agents can process real-time data streams for autonomous decision-making. This function allows the agent to simulate real-world conditions even if actual hardware (like health devices) is unavailable.

### 6. **Video Processing**
In the `process_video()` function, the agent analyzes video input to detect potential falls. Falls are a common emergency in healthcare, especially for elderly or disabled individuals. This function simulates video-based fall detection, a critical part of the agent's **perception** capabilities.

### 7. **Image Processing**
The `process_image()` function analyzes an image and detects the dominant facial emotion (e.g., happy, sad, angry, neutral). Emotion detection is a valuable tool for AI agents, especially in healthcare, as it helps the agent assess the emotional state of an individual, which may indicate distress or an emergency.

### 8. **Speech Processing**
The `process_speech()` function converts audio input (speech) into text using a pre-trained **Wav2Vec2** model. Speech recognition is another perception modality in multimodal agents, enabling them to understand verbal cues and respond to spoken commands. This capability is particularly useful in accessibility technologies where individuals may have difficulty interacting with traditional interfaces.

### 9. **Text Processing with LLaMA**
The `process_text_llama()` function uses the **LLaMA 3.2** model to analyze text input, such as a medical statement or patient notes. It generates a natural language explanation based on the data, determining if an emergency is present. This showcases how large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA are integrated into agents to enhance their reasoning and communication abilities.

### 10. **Data Fusion and Decision-Making**
The `data_fusion()` function integrates all the data streams—physiological data, video analysis, emotion detection, speech-to-text conversion, and text analysis—into a cohesive decision-making process. This is the core of the **autonomous agent's** intelligence, where it combines multiple sources of information to make real-time decisions about whether an emergency is occurring.

### 11. **Streamlit GUI Application**
The `medical_emergency_agent()` function is the main entry point for the application, providing a graphical user interface (GUI) where users can upload files, view results, and interact with the AI agent. The GUI is important for making AI systems accessible to users, allowing human operators to interact with the agent, provide feedback, and receive alerts in case of emergencies.

### 12. **Emergency Alarm and Fact-Checking**
If an emergency is detected, the system not only triggers visual and audio alarms but also allows the user to ask additional questions using the **LLaMA** model. This introduces the concept of **interactive agents**, which not only perform actions but also engage with users to explain their reasoning and provide additional insights. The fact-checking capability ensures that the model's outputs are verified against predefined rules or data.

### 13. **Running the Application**
Finally, the code contains a main block that starts the Streamlit app, enabling users to interact with the multimodal medical emergency detection system.
