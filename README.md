# **GuardianSense: Autonomous Multi-Modal Emergency Detection Agent for Disabled Persons**

## Overview  
**GuardianSense** is an AI-driven, autonomous multi-modal agent designed to assist disabled individuals by continuously monitoring their environment through various data inputs like video, image, text, speech, and URLs. Utilizing pretrained models on medical data, GuardianSense makes intelligent and autonomous decisions to detect potential emergencies and trigger alarms to notify caregivers or authorities in real-time. It offers a proactive approach to enhancing the safety and independence of individuals with disabilities by providing advanced monitoring and alerting solutions.

## Features  
- **Real-time video and image processing**: Detects unusual behavior, falls, or dangerous objects in the environment through video feeds and images.
- **Text and database integration**: Analyzes textual data from medical databases or personalized care instructions to assess health risks or changes in routine.
- **Speech recognition and processing**: Understands voice commands and verbal cues from users, providing an additional modality for detecting distress signals.
- **URL processing**: Monitors relevant web data sources or APIs that may provide critical information (e.g., weather alerts, health data).
- **Medical Decision-Making**: Uses pretrained models on medical data to autonomously assess user health and environmental risks, making decisions to trigger appropriate responses.
- **Emergency triggers**: Automatically triggers alarms or sends notifications in case of emergency events, alerting caregivers or emergency services.
- **Multi-modal integration**: Combines and processes data from multiple sources to form a holistic understanding of the user's environment and safety status.
